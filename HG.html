		<p>
			The objective of this chapter is mainly to guide hoteliers/accommodation-providers to be clear on
the actions to be taken during the post COVID-19 lockdown. We strongly recommend accommodation
providers/hotels to follow these guidelines to improve mitigation and recovery mission of the
accommodation sector.
It is also important to note that in the case of a different instruction to this guideline is issued by the state
health authorities, the stricter interpretation will be applicable</p>

			<h2>General information on important measures to be taken in
				accommodation facilities</h2>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;margin-top: 15px;">
				All indoor areas such as entrances, lobbies, corridors, staircases, escalators, elevators,
				security guard booths, office rooms, meeting rooms and cafeterias must be disinfected with a
				 recommended disinfectant.<br>
				60%-70% alcohol disinfectants must be used to wipe down metallic surfaces such as door handles,
				security locks, keys, etc. Please refer the MoH guidelines for more information regarding appropriate
				disinfectants and procedures. (Epidemiology Unit, Ministry of Health www.epid.gov.lk).<br>
				Based on the predicted occupancy levels the management should define/pre-plan the operational
				timings of each area and inform their guests accordingly. (Ex: restaurant and kitchen operational times).<br>
				Recommend segmented teams (Ex: teams within the department such as Team A, Team B and
				Team C) and ensure not to mix any team members through different scheduling of shifts; this must be done
				in order to prevent cross-transmission and total quarantining of the entire staff if any COVID-19 cases are
				found. Make necessary arrangements to cross-train staff (Inter department) to cope with any emergency
				situation of a department.<br>
			    Disposal of surgical masks every 4 to 6 hours after use is mandatory. Alternatively reusable face masks
				can be used as per product specifications.<br>
				 Maintain limited staff to minimize exposure to micro-germs during operations.<br>
				Maintain occupancy level at 50% or below when tourism operations resume.<br>
				 Ensure to have 60%-70% of alcohol hand rub/sanitizer dispensers at all entrances’ of elevator on every
				and in the close vicinity of public area entrances.<br>
				Limit the number of entry points to all parties concerned (visitors, guests, staff, etc.) to ensure
				accurate screening.<br>
				Floor markings to be in place to indicate 1.5 meter safe physical distancing at all busy areas
				(Ex: reception counters, buffet area, etc).<br>
				Based on room capacity of the facility, adequate number of isolation rooms (suitable, comfortable
				and well laid out) to be arranged which are equipped with necessary medical equipment, medicines,
				disinfectant and PPEs as per the directions given by the health authorities.<br>
				Adequate supplies of hand washing facilities, hand rub/sanitizers, PPEs (face masks, rubber gloves
				and impermeable aprons) must be maintained.<br>
				Do not employ any pregnant women in duties that involve chemicals and disinfectants.</p>

					<h2>Establishing a rapid response team and a management team</h2>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;margin-top: 15px;">
						The Management team should see to the circulation of accurate and updated information among staff
						through the RRT via briefing sessions to ensure;<br>
						The flow of correct and pre-defined information on any incident that may arise in the future.<br>
						Precautionary measures or any other related information are communicated effectively to the
						guests and to all other stakeholders to make sure the consistency and alignment.<br>
					    The RRT carries out debriefing in order to identify faulty procedures and discuss any changes required.<br>
						Another important factor is to communicate key messages at visible places for staff (in back of the house
						areas) and for guests (in public areas, hotel entrances, receptions, entrance to restaurants, all rooms) by
						using IEC materials. Such communications should include;
						Promoting hand washing and safe social distancing<br>
						Respiratory symptoms of COVID-19<br>
						Cleanliness and basic hygiene practices<br>
						Contact information of key staff personnel<br>
						Emergency telephone numbers</p>

						certification in the first phase.<br>
						All ‘Safe & Secure’ certified accommodation providers/hotels will be required to provide an undertaking
						that they strictly abide by all COVID-19 health and safety protocols.<br>
